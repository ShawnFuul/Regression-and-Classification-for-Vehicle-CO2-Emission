#### Data Source
The Data is available at: https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv).

#### Data Description
This dataset has some of the features of vehicles including 'Make', 'Vehicle Class', 'Engine Size', 'Cylinder', 'Transmissions', 'Fuel type' and 'Fuel Consumption'.  

#### Project Goal
The goal of the project is to figure out the relationship between vehicle features and CO2 emissions from the vehicles. The classification and regression methods were used to imply the relationships.

#### Conclusion 
3 different learning methods (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor Classification) were tested and the accuracy were analyzed.

By identities of different features, the models were built:

* Linear Regression:
